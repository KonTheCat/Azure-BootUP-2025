## Today's Topics: Management and Governance, Tooling, Automation

### Management and Governance
> Focus: Azure Policy, Management Groups, Resource Graph, and governance best practices.

#### Azure Policy Deep Dive
- **What is Azure Policy?**
  - Policy definitions: rules for resource compliance
  - Policy assignments: applying policies to scopes
  - Policy initiatives (policy sets): grouping related policies
  - Built-in policies vs custom policies
- **Policy effects**: Deny, Audit, Append, DeployIfNotExists, Modify
- **Compliance evaluation**: understanding compliance states
- **Remediation tasks**: fixing non-compliant resources
- **Policy exemptions**: when and how to use them

#### Management Groups
- **Hierarchy and inheritance**: subscription organization patterns
- **RBAC at scale**: assigning permissions across multiple subscriptions
- **Policy inheritance**: cascading governance rules
- **Best practices**: logical grouping strategies (by department, environment, business unit)

#### Azure Resource Graph
- **What is Resource Graph?**: query Azure resources at scale
- **Kusto queries for governance**: inventory, compliance, cost analysis
- **Common queries**:
  - Find all VMs by SKU size
  - Identify resources without required tags
  - List all public IP addresses
  - Track resource changes over time

#### Azure Blueprints (Overview)
- **Blueprints vs ARM templates**: orchestration + governance
- **Blueprint artifacts**: ARM templates, policies, RBAC, resource groups
- **Use cases**: compliant environment provisioning

### Tooling for Azure Administrators
> Focus: CLI tools, PowerShell, Azure CLI, and when to use each.

#### PowerShell for Azure
- **Azure PowerShell module (`Az`)**
  - Core cmdlets: `Get-AzVM`, `New-AzResourceGroup`, `Set-AzStorageAccount`
  - Authentication: `Connect-AzAccount`, service principals, managed identities
  - Working with multiple subscriptions
  - Pipeline patterns and filtering
- **When to use PowerShell**: Windows-centric environments, scripting complex logic

#### Azure CLI
- **Cross-platform administration**: Linux, macOS, Windows, Cloud Shell
- **Command structure**: `az <service> <subcommand> --parameters`
- **Output formats**: JSON (default), table, TSV, YAML
- **JMESPath queries**: filtering and transforming output
- **When to use Azure CLI**: cross-platform, CI/CD pipelines, simpler syntax

#### Azure Cloud Shell
- **Pre-configured environment**: no local installation needed
- **PowerShell vs Bash modes**: switching between them
- **Persistent storage**: CloudDrive for files and scripts
- **Editor integration**: built-in code editor

#### Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)
- **Infrastructure + application deployment**: end-to-end automation
- **Template-based workflows**: `azd init`, `azd up`, `azd down`
- **Integration with GitHub Actions**: automated deployments
- **When to use `azd`**: deploying full application stacks

### Azure Automation
> Focus: Automating operational tasks with Azure Automation service.

#### Azure Automation Fundamentals
- **What is Azure Automation?**
  - Process automation: runbooks for recurring tasks
  - Configuration management: Desired State Configuration (DSC)
  - Update management: patching VMs at scale
- **Automation Accounts**: container for automation resources
  - Managed identities for authentication (required)
  - RBAC permissions: granting access to automation accounts
  - Linking to Log Analytics workspace

#### Runbooks Deep Dive
- **Runbook types**: PowerShell, Python, Graphical
  - PowerShell runbooks: most common, full Azure cmdlet support
  - Python runbooks: cross-platform scripting
  - Graphical runbooks: visual workflow designer
- **Runbook lifecycle**: create, edit, publish, execute, monitor
- **Authentication in runbooks**: using managed identities
  ```powershell
  Connect-AzAccount -Identity
  Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "my-rg"
  ```
- **Input parameters**: making runbooks reusable
- **Scheduling runbooks**: time-based automation
- **Webhooks**: triggering runbooks from external systems

#### Automation Assets
- **Variables**: storing reusable values (encrypted or plain-text)
- **Credentials**: secure username/password storage
- **Certificates**: authentication certificates
- **Connections**: connection strings for external services
- **Modules**: PowerShell and Python package management

#### Common Automation Scenarios
- **Cost management**: auto-shutdown dev VMs after hours
- **VM management**: snapshot automation, backup verification
- **Storage management**: blob lifecycle management, cleanup tasks
- **Compliance**: tag enforcement, unused resource cleanup
- **Monitoring**: resource health checks, disk space alerts

#### Update Management
- **Update assessment**: view available updates across VMs
- **Update deployment**: schedule patching windows
- **Maintenance windows**: control deployment duration
- **Reboot management**: Always, IfRequired, Never
- **Pre/post scripts**: custom actions before/after updates

#### Hybrid Runbook Worker
- **Extending automation to on-premises**: manage resources outside Azure
- **Architecture**: Log Analytics agent + automation account
- **Use cases**: access private networks, local tools, data residency compliance

## Questions and Suggestions for Improvement

### Questions for Discussion:
1. What governance challenges do you face in your current work environment? How could Azure Policy help?
2. Which automation scenarios from today's content would provide the most value in your organization?
3. What aspects of the AZ-104 exam feel most challenging? What additional preparation would help?
4. What capstone project ideas are you considering? Do you need guidance on scope or complexity?

### Suggestions for Future Sessions:
- Would you like more hands-on automation workshops (e.g., building specific runbooks together)?
- Are there specific governance patterns (naming conventions, tagging strategies, RBAC models) you'd like to explore?
- Would a mock exam session be helpful for final preparation?
- What post-course support would be valuable (study group, shared resources, guest speakers)?
