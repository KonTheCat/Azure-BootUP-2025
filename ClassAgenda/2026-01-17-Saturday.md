# Class Agenda for Azure BootUP 2025 - AZ-104 - Azure Administrator
## Saturday, January 17, 2026 (2pm-6pm EST)

## Introductions
Welcome to Week 10! This is the penultimate weekend of our AZ-104 journey. Today we focus on **Management and Governance, Tooling, and Automation** — critical skills for Azure administrators managing production environments at scale.

## Housekeeping
- **Break**: Plan for at least one 15-minute break.
- **Labs + Applied Skills**: We'll align today's concepts to AZ-104 labs you can complete afterward.
- **Q&A Parking Lot**: Capture questions as we go; we'll circle back near the end.
- **Homework Reminder**: Make sure you've reviewed MS Learn content from last week.
- **Important**: Capstone project discussion and exam prep planning today!

## High-Level Recap (What We Covered in the Live Session)
Based on the Zoom AI meeting notes, here’s the high-level flow of what we actually covered.

- **Azure Policy (core)**: definitions, assignments, initiatives, effects, compliance evaluation, remediation, and exemptions
- **Policy authoring reality**: why policy is JSON-based, what “enforcement” means in practice, and how to start in Audit before moving to Deny
- **Demo (governance in action)**: using policy to restrict VM SKUs/sizes; understanding that evaluation/enforcement can take several minutes
- **Compliance frameworks**: using Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark + regulatory compliance standards as a “starting point” for governance conversations
- **Cloud Adoption Framework + landing zones**: why orgs use them, and how governance + RBAC form the foundation of scalable deployments
- **Exam prep approach**: using “Skills Measured” as a checklist, using practice exams to identify gaps, and time-management strategy
- **Exam-style deep dives (selected)**: VM + storage sizing tradeoffs, storage auth patterns, App Service scale limits, Azure Backup concepts, Private Link/network policy nuances, and locks vs RBAC boundaries

## What We Planned to Cover Next (Sunday)
- **Hands-on**: Lab 02b (Azure Policy) with initiatives + remediation focus
- **Tooling drills**: quick PowerShell vs Azure CLI practice blocks
- **Azure Automation**: runbooks, managed identity auth, jobs/output, schedules (deeper dive)
- **Capstone**: check-in + unblock time + optional show & tell
- **Final exam prep**: targeted review based on “Skills Measured” + practice-question discussion

## Today's Topics: Management and Governance, Tooling, Automation

### Management and Governance
> Focus: Azure Policy, Management Groups, Resource Graph, and governance best practices.

#### Azure Policy Deep Dive
- **What is Azure Policy?**
  - Policy definitions: rules for resource compliance
  - Policy assignments: applying policies to scopes
  - Policy initiatives (policy sets): grouping related policies
  - Built-in policies vs custom policies
- **Policy effects**: Deny, Audit, Append, DeployIfNotExists, Modify
- **Compliance evaluation**: understanding compliance states
- **Remediation tasks**: fixing non-compliant resources
- **Policy exemptions**: when and how to use them

#### Management Groups
- **Hierarchy and inheritance**: subscription organization patterns
- **RBAC at scale**: assigning permissions across multiple subscriptions
- **Policy inheritance**: cascading governance rules
- **Best practices**: logical grouping strategies (by department, environment, business unit)
