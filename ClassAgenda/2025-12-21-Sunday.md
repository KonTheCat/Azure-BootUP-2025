# Class Agenda for Azure BootUP 2025 - AZ-104 - Azure Administrator
## Sunday, December 21, 2025 (10am-2pm EST)

## Introductions
Today is a hands-on day focused on **Deployment Automation**: deploying repeatable infrastructure using **ARM templates**, **Bicep**, and **azd**.

## Session Goals
- Understand how ARM JSON and Bicep relate (and when to use each).
- Practice deploying templates safely (validation / what-if mindset).
- Get a first look at `azd` templates and the `azd` workflow.

## Labs (Hands-On)
Start here:
- **Labs Index (MSFTHub)**: [AZ-104 Labs](https://certs.msfthub.wiki/labs/azure/az-104/)

Suggested lab plan for today (Deployment Automation focus):
- **ARM templates (AZ-104 official lab)**:
	- [Lab 03b: Manage Azure resources by using Azure Resource Manager Templates](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/blob/master/Instructions/Labs/LAB_03b-Manage_Azure_Resources_by_Using_ARM_Templates.md)
- **Bicep (Learn exercise path)**:
	- [Implement Bicep (Microsoft Learn module)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-bicep/)
- **azd templates (guided workflow)**:
	- [What is the Azure Developer CLI?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)
	- [Azure Developer CLI templates overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-templates)
	- [Quickstart: Get started with the Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/get-started)
	- Example starter template repo: [hello-azd](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hello-azd)


## Applied Skills (Optional but Highly Recommended)
Pick one based on your focus:
- Networking focus (optional): [Configure secure access to your workloads using Azure networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/configure-secure-workloads-use-azure-virtual-networking?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290)

## Quick Review Topics (Q&A Driven)
- ARM vs Bicep: what changes (and what doesn’t)
- Deployments safety: validation and “preview before you apply” habits
- What `azd` is doing for you under the hood (high-level)
- Common exam traps and how to eliminate wrong answers

### Reference Docs (Review)
- [What are ARM templates?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)
- [What is Bicep?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview)

## Fun / Group Activity (15–20 min)
- **Scenario round-robin**: I’ll give 3 short architecture scenarios.
- You decide: **Load Balancer** or **Application Gateway** (and why), plus one deployment automation approach (ARM, Bicep, or `azd`).

## Wrap-Up
- Open Q&A
- Next steps: pick one lab to finish and one Applied Skill to attempt this week
