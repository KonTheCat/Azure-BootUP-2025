# Class Agenda for Azure BootUP 2025 - AZ-104 - Azure Administrator
## Sunday, January 11, 2026 (10am-2pm EST)

## Welcome to Sunday Session!
Today we have a special guest session followed by hands-on lab time and review.

## 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Special Session with Konstantin
### "Bridging Azure Admin and Developer Perspectives"

**Guest Speaker**: Konstantin

**Session Overview**: This session bridges the gap between Azure administration and development perspectives, showing how these roles collaborate and complement each other in modern cloud environments.

**Topics to be covered**:
- How Azure administration concepts enable development workflows
- Developer tooling that leverages Azure monitoring and backup capabilities
- CI/CD pipelines from an admin perspective: what resources get created, how to monitor them
- Security and compliance: developer responsibilities vs admin responsibilities
- Real-world collaboration scenarios:
  - Debugging production issues together (logs, metrics, Application Insights)
  - Implementing disaster recovery for applications
  - Cost optimization from both perspectives
- Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions integration with Azure monitoring
- Container and Kubernetes administration vs development perspectives
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform) collaboration patterns

**Format**: Interactive discussion with Q&A throughout
