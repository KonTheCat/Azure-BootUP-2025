## Capstone Project Planning

### Capstone Project Check-In + Optional Show & Tell (New)
- **Progress check-in (round-robin)**: what’s done, what’s next, biggest blocker
- **Optional show & tell**: quick 2–3 minute demo or portal walk-through (time permitting)
- **Q&A / unblock time**: architecture choices, scope sizing, security/monitoring questions

**What to bring**:
- Your current architecture (even a rough sketch)
- A short list of open questions and blockers
- 1 “exam crossover” concept you want reinforced via your capstone

### Capstone Project Overview
Your capstone project demonstrates your AZ-104 skills with a real-world scenario.

### Project Requirements
- **Deploy**: Create and configure Azure resources (compute, networking, storage)
- **Secure**: Implement RBAC, network security, Azure Policy
- **Monitor**: Set up monitoring and alerting
- **Document**: Create architecture diagram and deployment guide

### Project Timeline
- **Today**: Finalize your project idea and scope
- **This week**: Begin implementation and testing
- **Next Saturday (Jan 24)**: Project presentations (10 minutes each)

### Project Ideas
1. **Multi-tier web application with HA**
   - App Service or VMs for web tier
   - Azure SQL Database or Storage for data tier
   - Application Gateway or Load Balancer
   - Monitoring and auto-scaling

2. **Disaster recovery solution**
   - VM replication with Azure Site Recovery
   - Automated backup with Recovery Services Vault
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - DR failover testing plan

3. **Automated governance framework**
   - Management group hierarchy
   - Azure Policy for compliance
   - Automated tagging with remediation
   - Resource Graph queries for reporting

4. **Hybrid connectivity simulation**
   - VNet with multiple subnets
   - VPN Gateway setup (point-to-site or site-to-site simulation)
   - Network Security Groups and routing
   - DNS integration

5. **Cost optimization**
   - Budgets and cost alerts
   - Tagging for chargeback/showback
   - Unused resource identification
   - Cost analysis and reporting

### Project Scope Guidance
- **Too small**: Single VM deployment with basic monitoring
- **Just right**: Multi-resource solution with security and monitoring
- **Too large**: Complete enterprise landing zone with multiple subscriptions

### Questions to Answer Today
1. What problem does your project solve?
2. What Azure services will you use?
3. What are the key learning objectives?
4. What's your implementation timeline?
5. Do you need any specific guidance or resources?

### AI-Assisted Study Strategies

#### Using ChatGPT / GitHub Copilot for Exam Prep
1. **Generate practice questions**:
   - "Create 10 AZ-104 practice questions about Azure Policy"
   - "Generate scenario-based questions for virtual networking"

2. **Explain difficult concepts**:
   - "Explain the difference between Azure RBAC and Entra RBAC with examples"
   - "What's the difference between Load Balancer and Application Gateway?"

3. **Create study materials**:
   - "Create flashcards for Azure storage redundancy options"
   - "Generate a comparison table of VM SKU families"

4. **Practice teaching**:
   - Explain concepts to AI and ask for feedback
   - "I'll explain Azure Policy to you, tell me what I'm missing"

5. **Quiz yourself**:
   - Ask AI to quiz you on specific topics
   - Request increasing difficulty levels

### Exam Day Tips
- **Schedule wisely**: Choose morning (if you're a morning person) when you're most alert
- **Environment**: Quiet room, stable internet (for online proctored), no distractions
- **ID requirements**: Government-issued photo ID required
- **Arrive early**: 15 minutes before scheduled time
- **Read carefully**: Pay attention to keywords (NOT, EXCEPT, LEAST, MOST)
- **Time management**: ~1.5-2 minutes per question, flag difficult ones for review
- **Case studies**: Take brief notes on requirements, eliminate wrong answers
- **Stay calm**: If you're stuck, move on and come back

### Test-Taking Strategies
1. **Read the entire question** before looking at answers
2. **Identify keywords**: "MOST cost-effective", "LEAST administrative effort", "HIGHEST security"
3. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers** first
4. **Choose the BEST answer**, not just a correct answer
5. **For scenario questions**: Sketch the architecture if helpful
6. **Watch for trick answers**: services that don't exist or incorrect pairings
7. **Trust your preparation**: Your first instinct is usually correct

### Common Exam Topics to Master
- **RBAC**: Understanding scope (management group, subscription, resource group, resource)
- **Azure Policy vs RBAC**: When to use each
- **Virtual networking**: Subnets, NSGs, routing, service endpoints, private endpoints
- **Storage redundancy**: LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GZRS
- **VM management**: Availability sets, availability zones, scale sets
- **Load balancing**: When to use Load Balancer vs Application Gateway vs Traffic Manager
- **Backup and DR**: Recovery Services Vault, backup policies, Azure Site Recovery
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, KQL basics, alerts
