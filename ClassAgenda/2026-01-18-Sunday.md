### Additional Lab Resources
- [MSFTHUB Cert Wiki - AZ-104 Labs](https://certs.msfthub.wiki/labs/azure/az-104/)
- [MicrosoftLearning GitHub - All AZ-104 Labs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/)

### Automation Practice (Self-Guided)
If you complete the governance and tooling labs early, try these automation exercises:

#### Exercise 1: Create Your First Runbook
1. Create an Automation Account with managed identity
2. Grant the managed identity Reader permissions on a resource group
3. Create a PowerShell runbook that lists all VMs in that resource group
4. Publish and test the runbook
5. Review the job output

**Sample runbook**:
```powershell
# Lists all VMs in a resource group
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$ResourceGroupName
)

# Authenticate using managed identity
Connect-AzAccount -Identity

# Get all VMs
$vms = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Status

# Display VM names and power states
foreach ($vm in $vms) {
    Write-Output "VM: $($vm.Name) - Status: $($vm.PowerState)"
}

Write-Output "Total VMs found: $($vms.Count)"
```

#### Exercise 2: Schedule a Runbook
1. Create a schedule (e.g., "Daily at 6 PM")
2. Link your runbook to the schedule
3. Configure runbook parameters for scheduled execution
4. Verify the schedule is active

#### Exercise 3: Use Automation Variables
1. Create an automation variable (e.g., "DefaultResourceGroup")
2. Modify your runbook to use the variable instead of a parameter
3. Test the runbook with the variable value

#### Exercise 4: Azure Resource Graph Queries
Practice these queries in [Azure Resource Graph Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade):

**Query 1: Find all VMs by size**
```kusto
Resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
| project name, resourceGroup, location, vmSize = properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize
| order by vmSize asc
```

**Query 2: Resources without required tags**
```kusto
Resources
| where tags !has "Environment" or tags !has "Owner"
| project name, type, resourceGroup, tags
| order by type, name
```

**Query 3: Public IP addresses**
```kusto
Resources
| where type == "microsoft.network/publicipaddresses"
| project name, resourceGroup, location, ipAddress = properties.ipAddress, allocationMethod = properties.publicIPAllocationMethod
```

### AI-Assisted Study Strategies

#### Using ChatGPT / GitHub Copilot for Exam Prep
1. **Generate practice questions**:
   - "Create 10 AZ-104 practice questions about Azure Policy"
   - "Generate scenario-based questions for virtual networking"

2. **Explain difficult concepts**:
   - "Explain the difference between Azure RBAC and Entra RBAC with examples"
   - "What's the difference between Load Balancer and Application Gateway?"

3. **Create study materials**:
   - "Create flashcards for Azure storage redundancy options"
   - "Generate a comparison table of VM SKU families"

4. **Practice teaching**:
   - Explain concepts to AI and ask for feedback
   - "I'll explain Azure Policy to you, tell me what I'm missing"

5. **Quiz yourself**:
   - Ask AI to quiz you on specific topics
   - Request increasing difficulty levels

### Exam Day Tips
- **Schedule wisely**: Choose morning (if you're a morning person) when you're most alert
- **Environment**: Quiet room, stable internet (for online proctored), no distractions
- **ID requirements**: Government-issued photo ID required
- **Arrive early**: 15 minutes before scheduled time
- **Read carefully**: Pay attention to keywords (NOT, EXCEPT, LEAST, MOST)
- **Time management**: ~1.5-2 minutes per question, flag difficult ones for review
- **Case studies**: Take brief notes on requirements, eliminate wrong answers
- **Stay calm**: If you're stuck, move on and come back

### Test-Taking Strategies
1. **Read the entire question** before looking at answers
2. **Identify keywords**: "MOST cost-effective", "LEAST administrative effort", "HIGHEST security"
3. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers** first
4. **Choose the BEST answer**, not just a correct answer
5. **For scenario questions**: Sketch the architecture if helpful
6. **Watch for trick answers**: services that don't exist or incorrect pairings
7. **Trust your preparation**: Your first instinct is usually correct

### Common Exam Topics to Master
- **RBAC**: Understanding scope (management group, subscription, resource group, resource)
- **Azure Policy vs RBAC**: When to use each
- **Virtual networking**: Subnets, NSGs, routing, service endpoints, private endpoints
- **Storage redundancy**: LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GZRS
- **VM management**: Availability sets, availability zones, scale sets
- **Load balancing**: When to use Load Balancer vs Application Gateway vs Traffic Manager
- **Backup and DR**: Recovery Services Vault, backup policies, Azure Site Recovery
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, KQL basics, alerts
- **Azure Policy effects**: Deny, Audit, Append, DeployIfNotExists, Modify
- **Cost management**: Budgets, cost alerts, resource tagging

## 1:45 PM - 2:00 PM: Fun Activity & Closing

### Governance Scenario Challenge
**Scenario**: You're the Azure administrator for a growing company with 50 developers across 3 teams (Web, Mobile, Data). Resources are being created without tags, developers have too many permissions, and costs are spiraling out of control.

**Your task (5 minutes)**:
1. What governance strategy would you implement?
2. Which Azure Policy definitions would you use?
3. How would you organize subscriptions or management groups?
